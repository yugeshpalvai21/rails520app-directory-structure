  - Direct uploads to cloud storage services like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Microsoft Azure.
  - Supports image processing with built-in integration with libraries like MiniMagick and ImageProcessing.
  - Ability to attach one or many files to Active Record models.

## 2. Redis Cache Store
- **Introduction**: Rails 5.2 introduced Redis as a first-class cache store.
- **Features**:
  - Native support for Redis as a cache store, offering improved performance and scalability.
  - Supports Redisâ€™s advanced features like distributed caching and cache expiration.

## 3. Credentials Management
- **Introduction**: Rails 5.2 introduced a new way to manage credentials securely.
- **Features**:
  - Allows storing encrypted credentials (like API keys and secret tokens) in `config/credentials.yml.enc`.
  - Provides a simple command-line interface (`rails credentials:edit`) to edit and manage encrypted credentials.

## 4. Content Security Policy (CSP)
- **Introduction**: Content Security Policy is a security feature that helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Features**:
  - Rails 5.2 adds a new `ActionDispatch::ContentSecurityPolicy` middleware to easily configure CSP headers.

- **Features**:
  - Enhanced `rails secrets:setup` and `rails secrets:edit` commands for better management of secrets.
  - Improved error messages and debugging tools for CLI commands.

## 6. Cache Versioning
- **Introduction**: Cache versioning adds a new way to handle cache expiration more efficiently.
- **Features**:
  - Cache stores now support versions, making it easier to invalidate caches by simply changing the version.
  - Enhanced cache expiry management with minimal impact on application performance.

## 7. Disallowed Deprecation Warnings
- **Introduction**: To improve application stability, Rails 5.2 allows developers to disallow certain deprecation warnings.
- **Features**:
  - Provides the `config.active_support.disallowed_deprecation_warnings` configuration option.
  - Developers can list deprecations that should raise errors instead of just warnings.

## 8. Improvements to `ActiveRecord::Relation#or`
- **Introduction**: Rails 5.2 improved the `or` method for combining Active Record queries.
- **Features**:
  - Enhanced performance and flexibility when using `or` to combine multiple Active Record queries.
  - Supports more complex query combinations with minimal code.

## 9. Other Notable Changes
- **Action Cable**: Improved Action Cable performance and stability.
- **Encrypted Messages and Signed IDs**: Introduced encrypted and signed cookies for enhanced security.
- **Other Minor Improvements**: Various enhancements and bug fixes across the framework.
